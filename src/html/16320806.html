            About me & my future projects:
          </h2>
          <p>
            Couple of months ago, I have always had this invisible motivation
            that felt is there <span class="bold-text">but</span> never been
            able to do something with it. It's like I ready for the next step
            yet something was holding me back...
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Couple of events later; after seeing some people receiving fame that
            they do not deserve, I finally decided that I've had enough! I am
            ready to make a change and thats why I am working on some projects
            on both sides of <i><a href="#music-career-title">Music</a></i> and
            <i><a href="#programming-career-title">Programming.</a></i>
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            These projects are the start of something big, an artistic
            revolution for our country, something never seen before! It takes
            time and effort and a lot of energy & motive.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Here is a little story, I am someone who always loved music and the
            making of it! It inspires me how beautiful it is. Throughout time I
            met some people who helped me out to find other people that feel the
            same thing about music.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            After some time, I knew that having fame and money will make you
            feel isolated and lost, make your life seem like it is meaningless.
            That's the disadvantage of loving and making music.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My skills in music production grow better day after day, you have to
            love music in order to make good music; not like some other people
            that do it for money and fame. Not my thing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One thing about me is that I hate fame, it comes with a lot of
            problems. People think that another persons knowing your name is the
            coolest thing ever, I don't think it's the case.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Influence is like having a big responsibility, I remember I had a
            classmate that'd usually sit with my at lunchtime, then I would take
            out a cigarette and light it. Day after day, he started asking for
            puffs, which is something bad, obviously. I never gave him the
            chance to smoke with me yet 2 months later he started smoking double
            the amount I smoke.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Long story short, "Fame", "Money" & "Influence" are like my worst
            nightmares, so to my future self:
            <span class="bold-text">BEWARE THOSE THINGS.</span>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span id="story-sum" class="bold-text"
              >Enough of my boring life story, here is a quick summarization of
              the whole thing:</span

          <h3>Music-side:</h3>
          <p>
            We are working on a Hip-Hop/Melodic Rap Album that will have
            <span class="bold-text">me</span> as the
            <span class="bold-text">main producer.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            My producer name will be <span class="bold-text">Phantom.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Album will be released on
            <span class="bold-text">all online platforms.</span>
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Programming-side:</h3>
          <p>
            To this point I feel like
            <span class="bold-text">I am still learning,</span> I have gotten
            way better than I used to be though which means future projects are
            on the way <span class="bold-text">ASAP!</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A
            <span class="bold-text" style="text-transform: uppercase"
              >video game app</span
            >
            that will give the user the
            <span class="bold-text">experience</span> to live the events of the
            up-coming album!
          </p>
          <p>
            More <span class="bold-text">blogs</span> on this website to show
            off the <span class="bold-text">progress</span> we are making so
            far!
